Javascript Incremental Game. Made just for fun!

This project's true purpose is to practice modern web tech. The things I am most interested in learning with this project are 1) CSS Grid and CSS Flex, 2) React.js 3) Git 4) Help I'm trapped in vi! I'll put learning vi as a bonus subgoal. In the subgoal category I will also put Node.js.

#Game Concept: Incremental Clicker


#To Do
1. Need to get save system into a more organized state. Right now just want a more sensible way to save items.
2. Related to the first, a more sensible powe calculation.
3. Finally I want a basic basic UI for the game.
